# MQT Debugger - A Quantum Circuit Debugging Tool

A tool for debugging quantum circuits developed as part of the [_Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)_](https://mqt.readthedocs.io) by the [Chair for Design Automation](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/).
It proposes an interface for the simulation of circuits and diagnosis of errors and provides a base implementation built upon [MQT Core](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/core), which forms the backbone of the MQT.
It also provides a Debugger Adapter Protocol (DAP) server that can be used to integrate the debugger into IDEs.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us via [quantum.cda@xcit.tum.de](mailto:quantum.cda@xcit.tum.de) or by creating an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/debugger/issues).

## Getting Started

MQT Debugger is available via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.debugger/) for Linux, macOS, and Windows and supports Python 3.9 to 3.13.

```console
(venv) $ pip install mqt.debugger
```

The following code gives an example on the usage:

```python3
from mqt import debugger

state = debugger.create_ddsim_simulation_state()
with open("code.qasm", "r") as f:
    state.load_code(f.read())
f.run_simulation()
print(f.get_state_vector_full())
```

**Detailed documentation on all available methods, options, and input formats is available at [ReadTheDocs](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/debugger).**

## System Requirements and Building

The implementation is compatible with any C++20 compiler, a minimum CMake version of 3.19, and Python 3.9+.
Please refer to the [documentation](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/debugger) on how to build the project.

Building (and running) is continuously tested under Linux, macOS, and Windows using the [latest available system versions for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments).
